# Intent-Classification-using-Pytorch

This project is an implementation of intent classification on the classical ATIS dataset having 8 intents. The dataset is highly imbalanced with one of the intents having about 80% of the share. The code is implemented using Pytorch and Hugging Face implementation of BERT and run on Google Colab with Nvidia Tesla GPU.
The running time is not more than 20mins(depends on the GPU and RAM available, here free version of colab has been used).
